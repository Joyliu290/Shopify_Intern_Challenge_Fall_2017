# Shopify_Intern_Challenge_Fall_2017
I made this app to challenge my abilities in programming and UI designs with the goal of completing Shopify's Intern Programming Challenge for Fall 2017. 
This app uses the supplied page from Shopify, which is a page of unformated JSON data containing selling info of a company's products, and output the revenue of each product and total revenue of a specific product.
